# This is how to add TV Card Dwains Dashboard Blueprint
This is a custom blueprint for my case which include a house full of samsung tvs.  This has hardcoded references due to the fact that I set up all of my TV with the exact same apps in the first 4 locations on that Apps Bar on the Home menu on the TVs.
