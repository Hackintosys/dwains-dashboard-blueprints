# This is how to add TV Card Dwains Dashboard Blueprint
This is a custom blueprint for my case which include a house full of samsung tvs.  This has hardcoded references due to the fact that I set up all of my TVs with the exact same apps in the first 4 locations on that Apps Bar on the Home menu. 

I have switched to buttons instead of track pad and I have it as the pop up card for my TV entities
